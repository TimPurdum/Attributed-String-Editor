# Attributed-String-Editor
Edit NSAttributedStrings with a toolbar and convert to HTML

Type into the top box. Use the toolbar above the keyboard to select Bold, Italic, Underline, Bullets, or Numbers.

In the bottom box, you will get fully formed HTML code. This is useful for syncing from an iOS app to a server and other platforms.
